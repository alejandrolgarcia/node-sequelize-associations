# Creating Sequelize Associations with the Sequelize CLI

Let’s start by installing Postgres, Sequelize, and the Sequelize CLI in a new project folder:

```
mkdir sequelize-associations
cd sequelize-associations
npm init -y
npm install sequelize pg
npm install --save-dev sequelize-cli
```

Next, let’s initialize a Sequelize project, then open the whole directory in our code editor:

```
npx sequelize-cli init
```
